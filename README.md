# sentry-node
Autonomous sentry node: Haskell core with STM concurrency, YOLOv8/SORT perception pipeline, LLM vs rule-based threat eval, and DC motor visual servoing.  Built on a typed port of Lattice entity schema for my own understanding. Hardware specs were built with whatever I could find at home.
